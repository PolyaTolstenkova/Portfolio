Here you can find four of my newest projects. 
1. Clima -->
This application is for weather forecast. 
In this project I used the API "Open weather", that helped me to show user the weather from all over the world. Also I added CoreLocation framework to listen to updates of user's current location. 

2. ByteCoin -->
This application shows the current price of Bitcoin in selected currency. 
Here I used "coinapi.io" to get the price. 

3. Flash Chat -->
This app is an one-page chat with a capability to register and login the user.
I added Firebase into this project (FirebaseAuth & FirebaseStore) using CocoaPods, so as to be able saving users and their messages. Also I added CLTypingLabel to make my title animated in the root ViewController of my project. Additionaly I included IQKeyboardManagerSwift using Swift Package Manager to make my keyboard looking well.

4. H4X0R News --> 
This is an application with news from https://news.ycombinator.com/ 
It's made with SwiftUI's help. Here I used this API - https://hn.algolia.com/api . Also you can find WebKit there, that helps user to open the in-app browser and read the article.
